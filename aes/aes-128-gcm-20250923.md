AES-GCM encryption code explanation:

## **Step 1: Generate a Random Key**
```python
key = get_random_bytes(16)  # AES-128
print("Key (base64):", base64.b64encode(key).decode())
```
- **Purpose**: Creates a cryptographically secure 128-bit (16-byte) key
- **Details**: 
  - `get_random_bytes(16)` generates 16 random bytes using a secure random number generator
  - Base64 encoding makes the binary key readable and storable
  - Same key will be used for both encryption and decryption

## **Step 2: Create AES-GCM Cipher**
```python
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM)
nonce = cipher.nonce
print("Nonce (base64):", base64.b64encode(nonce).decode())
```
- **GCM Mode**: Galois/Counter Mode - provides both confidentiality and authentication
- **Nonce** (Number Used Once):
  - Random value generated automatically (typically 12 bytes)
  - Similar to IV in CBC mode, but with different security properties
  - Must be unique for each encryption with the same key
  - Unlike CBC, GCM doesn't require padding

## **Step 3: Encryption with Authentication**
```python
plaintext = b"Hello, AES-128 GCM encryption!"
ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(plaintext)
```
- **Single Operation**: `encrypt_and_digest()` performs both encryption and authentication
- **Outputs**:
  - `ciphertext`: The encrypted data
  - `tag`: Authentication tag (16 bytes typically) - cryptographic proof of integrity

**What happens internally:**
1. **Encryption**: Plaintext is encrypted using AES in counter mode
2. **Authentication**: Computes a MAC (Message Authentication Code) over the ciphertext
3. **No Padding Needed**: GCM uses stream cipher mode, so data doesn't need to be padded to block size

## **Step 4: Decryption with Verification**
```python
decipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce=nonce)
decrypted = decipher.decrypt_and_verify(ciphertext, tag)
```
- **Critical Security Feature**: `decrypt_and_verify()` automatically verifies the authentication tag before returning decrypted data

**What happens internally:**
1. **Recreate Cipher**: Initialize with same key and nonce
2. **Decrypt**: Reverse the encryption process
3. **Verify Tag**: Recomputes the authentication tag and compares it with the provided tag
4. **Automatic Validation**: If tags don't match, raises an exception (`ValueError`) - this prevents tampered ciphertext from being accepted

## **Key Advantages of GCM over CBC**

### **Security Benefits:**
1. **Authentication**: Built-in integrity checking prevents tampering
2. **No Padding**: Eliminates padding oracle attacks
3. **Parallel Processing**: Can encrypt/decrypt multiple blocks simultaneously
4. **Performance**: Generally faster than CBC mode

### **Authentication Tag Importance:**
- The tag proves that:
  - Ciphertext hasn't been modified
  - Encryption was done with the correct key
  - Nonce hasn't been tampered with

## **What Happens if Tampering Occurs**
```python
# Example of tampering detection
tampered_ciphertext = ciphertext[:-1] + b'x'  # Modify last byte

try:
    decipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM, nonce=nonce)
    decrypted = decipher.decrypt_and_verify(tampered_ciphertext, tag)
    # This will raise ValueError: MAC check failed
except ValueError as e:
    print("Tampering detected!", str(e))
```

## **Complete Data Flow**
```
Plaintext → [GCM Encryption] → Ciphertext + Authentication Tag
                                 ↓
Ciphertext + Tag → [GCM Decryption] → Plaintext (if authentic) OR Exception
```

## **Important Security Notes**
1. **Nonce Management**: Never reuse a (key, nonce) pair - it completely breaks security
2. **Tag Storage**: Always store/transmit the authentication tag with the ciphertext
3. **Key Security**: Protect the encryption key at all times
4. **Standard Practice**: GCM is recommended for new applications over CBC mode

This implementation provides a more modern and secure approach to encryption compared to the previous CBC example, with built-in protection against common cryptographic attacks.
