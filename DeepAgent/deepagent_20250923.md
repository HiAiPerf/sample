DeepAgent with LangGraph agent code:

## 1. **Imports and Dependencies**
```python
import operator
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
from langchain_core.agents import AgentAction, AgentFinish
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
```
- **operator**: Used for state management operations
- **TypedDict, Annotated**: For type hints and state definition
- **AgentAction/AgentFinish**: Represent agent decisions (take action vs finish)
- **@tool**: Decorator to create tools the agent can use
- **StateGraph, END**: LangGraph components for building agent workflows

## 2. **State Definition**
```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    input: str
    chat_history: List[str]
    agent_outcome: Annotated[AgentAction, operator.add]
    intermediate_steps: Annotated[List, operator.add]
```
Defines the agent's memory/state that persists through the execution:
- **input**: User's question
- **chat_history**: Conversation history
- **agent_outcome**: LLM's decision (action to take or final answer)
- **intermediate_steps**: History of tool executions with results

The `Annotated[..., operator.add]` means these fields accumulate values.

## 3. **Tool Definition**
```python
@tool
def get_current_weather(location: str):
    """Fetches the current weather for a location."""
    return f"The weather in {location} is 75 degrees and sunny."
```
Creates a tool the agent can use. In a real application, this would call a weather API.

## 4. **Graph Nodes (Core Logic)**

### **LLM Node**
```python
def run_llm(state: AgentState):
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview", temperature=0)
    prompt = f"You are a helpful assistant. Answer the user's question: {state['input']}. Use tools if needed."
    
    return {"agent_outcome": AgentFinish(return_values={"output": "The current weather is 75 degrees and sunny."}, log="")}
```
**What it does**: 
- Takes the current state
- Would normally call an LLM with a prompt
- **In this simplified version**: Immediately returns a final answer (`AgentFinish`) instead of using tools

### **Tool Execution Node**
```python
def execute_tool(state: AgentState):
    action = state['agent_outcome']
    if action.tool == "get_current_weather":
        return {"intermediate_steps": [(action, get_current_weather.invoke(action.tool_input["location"]))]}
    else:
        return {"intermediate_steps": [(action, "Tool not found.")]}
```
**What it does**:
- Takes the LLM's action decision
- Executes the appropriate tool
- Stores the tool execution result in `intermediate_steps`

## 5. **Conditional Logic**
```python
def should_continue(state: AgentState):
    if isinstance(state['agent_outcome'], AgentFinish):
        return "end"
    else:
        return "continue"
```
**Decision point**: 
- If LLM returns `AgentFinish` → go to END (agent is done)
- If LLM returns `AgentAction` → go to tool execution

## 6. **Graph Construction**
```python
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("llm", run_llm)          # LLM decision node
workflow.add_node("action", execute_tool)  # Tool execution node

# Conditional routing from LLM
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "llm",
    should_continue,  # Decision function
    {
        "continue": "action",  # If tool needed → execute tool
        "end": END            # If answer ready → finish
    }
)

workflow.add_edge("action", "llm")  # After tool → back to LLM
workflow.set_entry_point("llm")     # Start with LLM
```

**Graph Flow**:
```
START → [LLM Node] → Should continue?
         ↓              ↓
      [Action Node] ← "continue"
         ↓
      "end" → END
```

## 7. **Execution**
```python
app = workflow.compile()  # Build the executable graph
inputs = {"input": "What's the weather in Toronto?"}
result = app.invoke(inputs)  # Run the agent
```

## **Key Execution Steps**:

1. **Start** with user input: `"What's the weather in Toronto?"`
2. **LLM Node**: `run_llm()` is called with the initial state
3. **Decision**: LLM returns `AgentFinish` (final answer) instead of `AgentAction` (tool use)
4. **Conditional Check**: `should_continue()` sees `AgentFinish` → returns `"end"`
5. **Graph routes to END** since answer is ready
6. **Result** contains the final weather response

## **What's Missing (Simplification)**:
In a real agent, the LLM would first return `AgentAction` to use the weather tool, then after tool execution, return `AgentFinish` with the final answer. This code shortcuts directly to the final answer.

The power of LangGraph is in building complex, stateful agent workflows with cycles, conditional logic, and persistent memory.
